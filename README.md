# Create A Machine Learning Modeling Using IBM Watson Studio and IBM Db2 On Cloud

This code pattern will demonstrate a data scientist's journey in creating a machine learning model using IBM Watson Studio and IBM Db2 On Cloud. We will showcase how to these products work together seamlessly to create a more enjoyable expierence.

## Flow

## Steps

1. [Clone The Repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create an IBM on Cloud Account](#2-create-an-ibm-on-cloud-account)
3. Load Data onto IBM Db2 on Cloud
4. Setup Watson Studio Project
5. Make Machine Learning Model  


### 1. Clone The Repo
Befor we start anything, we need to clone the repo. The repo has our dataset and  python notebook which we will use when creating our model.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohithravin/MachineLearningWithWatsonAndDB2.git
```

### 2. Create an IBM on Cloud Account
