# Create A Machine Learning Modeling Using IBM Watson Studio and IBM Db2 On Cloud

This code pattern will demonstrate a data scientist's journey in creating a machine learning model using IBM Watson Studio and IBM Db2 On Cloud. We will showcase how to these products work together seamlessly to create a more enjoyable expierence. 

## Flow

## Steps

1. [Clone The Repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create an IBM Cloud Account](#2-create-an-ibm-cloud-account)
3. [Load Data into IBM Db2 on Cloud](#3-load-data-into-ibm-db2-on-cloud) 
4. Setup Watson Studio Project
5. Make Machine Learning Model  


### 1. Clone The Repo
Before we start anything, we need to clone the repo. The repo has our dataset and  python notebook which we will use when creating our model.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohithravin/MachineLearningWithWatsonAndDB2.git
```

### 2. Create an IBM Cloud Account

Go to the link below and create a free IBM on Cloud Account.

[IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com)

Creating this account will give us access to create a Db2 on Cloud and Watson Studio service. 

### 3. Load Data into IBM Db2 on Cloud
Now that we have created our IBM Cloud account. We need to create a Db2 on Cloud service. Once we have create that, we will then we able to load our data into our database. 

1. [Create Db2 on Cloud Service](#3a-create-db2-on-cloud-service)
2. [Load Data into Db2 on Cloud](#3b-load-data-into-db2-on-cloud)

#### 3a. Create Db2 on Cloud Service

#### 3b. Load Data into Db2 on Cloud
